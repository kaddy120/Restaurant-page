# Restaurant-page
A simple Restaurant page in which the whole website content is dynamically
rendered using vanilla `JavaScript`. The idea behind the project was to
understand the pain point of creating a single page application (SPA) without using SPA 
framework like [react.js](https://react.dev/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), etc. 
This project also implements a simple routing using
`JavaScript` to switch between `home`, `menu` and `contact` page.
